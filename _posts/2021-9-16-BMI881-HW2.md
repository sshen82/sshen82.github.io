This article mainly talks about means of communication for cholera. In the beginning, it uses a lot of examples to state that cholera is communicated from person to person, 
and is spreaded by contaminated water, rather than effluvia. It also proved that the disease is caused by the morbid poison in the alimentary canal. It finally prove that
the cases are caused by contaminated water using a lot of examples. One interesting example is the difference of cholera prevalence between areas supplied by different 
water companys.

In this article, the author uses an extremely thorough way to evaluate each sample, and gives a correct statement of how cholera is spreaded. I don't really know how epidemiology 
works, but I feel that this is the text-book example to learn both for research and for stopping a disease.
