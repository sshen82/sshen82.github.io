This article mainly talks about means of communication for cholera. In the beginning, it uses a lot of examples to state that cholera is communicated from person to person, 
and is spreaded by contaminated water, rather than effluvia. It also proved that the disease is caused by the morbid poison in the alimentary canal. It finally prove that
the cases are caused by contaminated water using a lot of examples. One interesting example is the difference of cholera prevalence between areas supplied by two different 
water companys.
