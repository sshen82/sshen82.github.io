In the article, the author used deep learning to predict nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC). 
1829 patients with NMSC as their first diagnosed cancer were included as cases and 7665 
random patients without cancer were included as controls in the analysis. They built image-like
matrices using EMR and build a convolutional neural network and train the model. The AUROC is 0.89.
They also identified features that contribute to NMSC.

For the model itself, I don't see much problems, but in turns of predicting diseases, I am relatively
against applying the model directly, since there are ethical problems. Currently I believe the application 
is still AI-assisted diagnosis, so it makes more sense to me.

For the paper, I do have some questions:

1. The sample is imbalanced, and I think deep learning is sensitive to this. I wonder if they will provide any proof that it doesn't affect the result?
2. Will there be missing data in the database? I feel that this kind of huge system often contains NAs.
3. The following up question from 2 is that will the database "evolve"? What I mean is that from 1999 to 2013, the database maybe able to include more features, but there will be missing data before a new variable is included.
