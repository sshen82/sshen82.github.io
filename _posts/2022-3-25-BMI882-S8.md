The first paper uses a way to calculate the recombination rate between two very close mutants.It defines a "pseudo-allelism" test to divide the region into two functionally distinguishable segments. The second paper further bases on the first one, proves the linear structure of DNA, and defines a "gene".

The papers are not easy to read, so I find this video quite useful. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTEdiXyPN_A) The paper is indeed pioneering, but I have one question, that is what is the use of the condition S? B and K can be used to calculate the reversion rate, but I don't see S being helpful. The video I shared also didn't talk about this condition.
