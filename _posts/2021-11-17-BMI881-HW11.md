This article gives a possibility that we can use the graphs to to hypothesis testing when we can't use the original data to do this. The basic procedure is to find K observers 
and ask them which plot is different from others. Then, we use Binomial distribution to describe the distribution, and the p-value can be calculated. It also gives a way to 
evaluate the ability of observers.

This paper is really strange to me. For me, I can't really think of a situation that the data can be visualized but can't be tested. Even in the most tricky cases, one may be able
to create a empirical distribution and compare this against the real one by the permutation test. It might be time consuming, but I think it is better than hiring others to look 
at the result. I guess I will need to listen to the course on this topic to really understand the value of this.

Questions:

1. What is the situation that this kind of method can be used?
2. Is this worth it to hire someone to look at the data? Collecting the data is already quite expensive.
3. The figure itself will sometimes be very ambiguous. Taking the log scale or not will make a big difference. Does the author talk about this?
