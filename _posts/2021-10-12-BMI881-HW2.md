This is in relation to the paper on predicting nonmelanoma skin cancer, Wang et al. (2019).

1. If a test has sensitivity = 80% and specificity 80% and the prevalence of the disease is 9/100,000, what is the positive predictive value (aka “precision”) of the test?

2. Suppose sensitivity = specificity. What would they have to be to achieve positive predictive value = 50% when prevalence is 9/100,000?

Comment on these results in relation to the precision values provided in Table 2 of Wang et al. (2019).

## Answer:

1. sensitivity =  number of true positives / (number of true positives + number of false negatives) = TP / (TP + FN) = 80%

specificity = number of true negatives / (number of true negatives + number of false positives) = TN / (TN + FP) = 80%

FN / TP = FP / TN = 1 / 4.

(TP + FN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN) = 9 / 100000, so (TP + FN) / (TP + TN) * 80% = 9 / 100000, so (400000 / 9 - 4) FN = TN.

FP = 1/4 TN = 1/4(400000 / 9 - 4) FN = 1/16(400000 / 9 - 4) TP. TP / (TP + FP) = 36 / 100027.

2. Let a = sensitivity = specificity. FN / TP = FP / TN = (1-a) / a, TN = (100000 a / 9(1-a) - a / (1-a)) FN. FP = (1-a) / a * (100000 / 9 - 1) TP.

TP / (TP + FP) = 1 / (1 + (1 - a) / a * (100000 / 9 - 1)) = 50%, a = 1 - 9 / 100000 = 99.991%.

If the prevalence of the disease is very low, we need sensitivity and specificity to be very very high to get a precision equivalent to random guess.

In the Want et al. study, 1829 patients with nonmelanoma skin cancer and 7665 random controls were included in the analysis. The Sn = 83.1%, Sp = 82.3%, Precision = 57.1%. However, the NMSC prevalence is 2.3 to 9.2 per 100,000 population. The precision will be very low as is shown above. The result in this paper is thus unreliable.
