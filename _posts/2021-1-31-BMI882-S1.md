In this article, the author discussed the concept of data tidying and packages "plyr" and "ggplot2" for easy analysis of "cleaned" data. This article gave several examples of how
messy tables can be turned into tidy ones. It also gave most common problems with messy datasets: 

Column headers are values, not variable names;

Multiple variables are stored in one column;

Variables are stored in both rows and columns;

Multiple types of observational units are stored in the same table;

A single observational unit is stored in multiple tables.

This type of format is helpful in that it is easier to perform basic statistical analysis on them, like regression and ploting. If a data table contains problems mentioned above, 
it is indeed hard to plot it directly. It is also clearer when we are directly looking at the data in most cases. However, as the author also mentioned in the artivle, this format
is sometimes not efficient. It is like saving a sparse matrix, and when the data is not too sparse, it is more memory and storage consuming to save the data in a sparse way. 
Other types of computation are also slower. For example, for a matrix that rows are columns are features, it is easy to perform row sum and column sum on them, but it is much 
harder if the data is presented in a tidy way.
