This paper talks about batch effect by first stating that a lot of previous experiments contain batch effect, and this hinders, even confounds the biological insights.
The batch effect mostly result from the poor experiment design. The authors then gave solutions to this problem. For the experimenters, they should try their best to 
give a better experiment design to avoid high or even extreme confounding. For statisticians, tools like SVA can be used to eliminate the effect.

Batch effect removal is a really important problem in single-cell genomics. In scRNA-seq, tons of methods have been proposed to eliminate the batch effect. Based on my
own experience, this paper is more important for biologists because of the suggestion at the end. For statisticans, if the batch effect is not severe, then there are 
a lot of methods available to remove it, and if the batch effect is severe, nothing can be done. I was expecting to see a solution for extreme batch effect, but disappointed.
