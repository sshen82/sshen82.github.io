In this paper, the author gives an overview on causal inference based on Structural Causal Model (SCM). It contrasts causal analysis with standard statistiacal analysis, provides
new mathematical notations needed for this new tool, discusses in detail the fundamentals of the structural theory of causation, and uses these modeling fundamentals to represent 
interventions and develop mathematical tools for estimating causal effects and counterfactual quantities.

This is a great paper, that gives a detailed introduction of causal inference using SCM. However, the first thing is that I feel strange when it proves the equivalence between 
E(Y|do(x)) and E(Y|X = x). Why is the new notification needed then? Also, I feel that the do() operator is just like picking a subgroup analysis, and it reminds me of the 
matching technique using propensity score. 

Questions:

1. How is the graph obtained in the first place? Using former knowledge?
2. What is the connection between Pearl's version and Rubin's version of causal inference?
