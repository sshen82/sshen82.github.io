For this table, I use facet to represent income groups, since they are not significantly different. In each plot, I use different colors to represent age groups.

Since one group is much higher than others, I took logarithm of the mortality rate, and was able to look at the difference among ages.

Simply looking at the plot, we can conclude that the ages are different, but the incomes are not. There seems to be difference between low and middle against other groups, but this requires more rigorous testing.

library(ggplot2)
library(data.table)
dat = fread("~/Downloads/feigin2014_table1_mortality.csv")

ggplot(dat, aes(x = year, y = log(mortality_rate), col = age_group)) + 
  geom_line() + facet_grid(cols = vars(income_group)) + theme_bw(base_size = 15) + 
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = log(interval_low), ymax = log(interval_high)), alpha = 0.1)
