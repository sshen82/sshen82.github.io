In this paper, it tried to have an understanding of the discrepancy between the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) randomized trial and the previous observational studies of the 
Nurses' Health Study (NHS). The WHI randomized trial showed that the hormone replacement therapy increases the risk of coronary heart disease in women, but NHS showed the 
contrary. The authors reanalyzed the data from the observational NHS, by emulating the design and the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis of the randomized trial. The ITT analysis
estimates were similar to those from the Women's Health Initiative. The conclusion 
is that the discrepancies between WHI and NHS-ITT estimates could largely be explained by differences in the distribution of time since menopause and the length of follow-up.

The article is great in that it succeeds in finding the reason for the differences between two studies. However, I think the method itself is not quite reliable, and I am more in 
favor of the randomized trial like WHI.

For the paper, I do have one question:

1. The data is imbalanced. Will this reduce the power?
