This paper extends the SNE method to t-SNE, that enables a better dimension reduction that can separate clusters and find the intrinsic relationships among samples. It also 
provides a version for larger datasets. The authors also demonstrate the superiority of their method on various datasets. Finally, they discuss the weakness of the method.

t-SNE is widely used in multi-omics data, and it is really easy to use. There are a lot of vintage points for this method and I benefit from this a lot already. However, 
recently, I see a paper "The Specious Art of Single-Cell Genomics" that this kind of method cannot preserve the true local and global structure of the real data. (This is also
mentioned in the t-SNE paper that one of the weakness is that there is curse of intrinsic dimension.) It is making me rethink the use of t-SNE and UMAP, and I am curious about
other's opinion in the class.
