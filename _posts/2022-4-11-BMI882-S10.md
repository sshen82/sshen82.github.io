In this paper, the authors proposed a new approach to multiple testing. Similar to p-value, this is a measure of significance in terms of the false discovery rate 
rather than the false positive rate. The authors gave some example related to genomic study, and mostly gave a detailed explanation on the method.

For this method, I only meet this when doing motif analysis, so I am not very familiar with it. Sorry, but I don't have much idea on this.
