In the article, they provide a tool to perform data visualization. In specific, the tool is used for visualizing complex structures among intersection of sets.
They also provide a website that enables convenient exploration of the data. (I personally prefer their R implementation of the UpSet method, but having a website is nice.)

The website and the method is good, but there are aspects that are poor. The first one is personal, that in my area, we normally don't need to look at complex sets. The only thing we do now is the intersection of genes in different gene sets, and that only requires a venn diagram. The second part is about the paper, which is not well written. The first six pages are mostly talking about other works, and this make me wonder if it is necessary to include this many related works. Nevertheless, it is a great work to explore data before really diving into it.
