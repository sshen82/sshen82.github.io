In this article, the authors talks about bootstrapping on regression residuals, and compare this with asymptotic estimation. They
claimed that the asymptotic estimation will be optimistic and use simulation and mathematical prove to confirm this. The empirical 
result showed that the asymptotic estimation for standard errors are too optiimistic comparing to the bootstrapping standard errors.

I don't have much view on bootstrapping, except with the question that since the bootstrapping is better than asymptotic result in 
finite-sample setting, do people use bootstrapping for more?
